# Project MC01

Advanced Databases Project.
MC01 is a web  School Management Application that allows users to search for data from a database of a school using a web interface. The application is built using the Stack **JOLT** ([Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html), [OracleSQL](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/sql-developer.html), [Linux](https://www.oracle.com/linux/), [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/)).
- **UML** Designed with [LucidChart](https://lucid.app/), you can see the diagram [here](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/e151864c-2d4a-4bcb-aab4-2fb80088c6a5/edit?viewport_loc=1305%2C392%2C963%2C1507%2CnzITqXaFRXv0&invitationId=inv_0e2e08d2-6bc3-427c-bc0e-e5b9ce386790).

### Setup
- The application will run on `localhost:7000` (temporarely). I must look for a web hosting service to deploy the application.
- Run `School Management/src/main/java/web/LaunchApplication.java` to start the application. 


----
### Development Tools:

- [Spring 2.7.5](https://spring.io/) as the web development framework.
- [OracleSQL](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/sql-developer.html) as the database.
- [OracleLinux 7.9](https://www.oracle.com/linux/) as the operating system that hosts the database.
- [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/) as the web server.


### Planning Tools:
- [obsidian(1.0.3)](https://obsidian.md/) as a notebook.
- [LucidChart](https://lucid.app/): **UML creation tool**.
- [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) as the **schedule**.
- [Figma](https://figma.com/) as the **UserInterface development tool**.
